Importing Libraries: The first step is to import the necessary libraries—openpyxl and json—which will be used for reading Excel files and writing the JSON file, respectively.

Opening the Workbook: The workbook is loaded by specifying its path on the local machine. Afterward, the specific worksheet containing the required data is accessed and stored in a variable named sheet.

Determining Columns: To efficiently navigate the spreadsheet, the max_column method is called on the sheet to get the total number of columns in use. This number typically includes one extra column, as max_column counts the last used column, even if it's blank. This helps us determine the range for column iteration.

Creating the Data Structure: A dictionary, data, is initialized to store the parsed menu information in an organized manner.

Iterating Through Columns and Rows: A loop is initiated to traverse through the columns (from 1 to column_no), inside which nested loops are used to traverse the rows based on specific criteria. For example, breakfast items start at row 4, and the loop continues until it encounters the next menu section (i.e., lunch or dinner).

Defining the End of Menu Sections: A custom function is used to identify where the last item of each section (breakfast, lunch, dinner) ends, based on the repetition of the word "day" in the corresponding column. This helps us avoid unnecessary empty rows and ensures the extraction is limited to actual menu items.

Checking Cell Conditions: During the row iteration, each cell is checked for two conditions:

If the cell is blank (i.e., its value is None).
If the cell contains "*******" (indicating a separator or an invalid item). If either of these conditions is met, the item is skipped.
Storing Menu Items: Valid items are appended to separate lists for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, depending on which section they belong to. These lists are then added to a menu dictionary with appropriate keys for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Assembling the Final Data: After processing each date's menu, the menu dictionary is added to the main data dictionary, using the date as the key. This process is repeated for all dates in the loop.

Writing Data to JSON: Once the entire dataset has been processed, the json.dump() method is used to write the data dictionary to a JSON file. To ensure the output is readable, the indent=2 argument is passed, which formats the JSON file with a 2-space indentation for clarity.
